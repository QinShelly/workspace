-- Query 1 - Top Cumulative Waits ***********************************************************

-- Isolate top waits for server instance since last restart or statistics clear

-- Common Significant Wait types with BOL explanations

-- *** Network Related Waits ***
-- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO		Occurs on network writes when the task is blocked behind the network

-- *** Locking Waits ***
-- LCK_M_IX				Occurs when a task is waiting to acquire an Intent Exclusive (IX) lock
-- LCK_M_IU				Occurs when a task is waiting to acquire an Intent Update (IU) lock
-- LCK_M_S				Occurs when a task is waiting to acquire a Shared lock

-- *** I/O Related Waits ***
-- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION  Occurs when a task is waiting for I/Os to finish
-- IO_COMPLETION		Occurs while waiting for I/O operations to complete. 
--                      This wait type generally represents non-data page I/Os. Data page I/O completion waits appear 
--                      as PAGEIOLATCH_* waits
-- PAGEIOLATCH_SH		Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is in an I/O request. 
--                      The latch request is in Shared mode. Long waits may indicate problems with the disk subsystem.
-- PAGEIOLATCH_EX		Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is in an I/O request. 
--                      The latch request is in Exclusive mode. Long waits may indicate problems with the disk subsystem.
-- WRITELOG             Occurs while waiting for a log flush to complete. 
--                      Common operations that cause log flushes are checkpoints and transaction commits.
-- PAGELATCH_EX			Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is not in an I/O request. 
--                      The latch request is in Exclusive mode.
-- BACKUPIO				Occurs when a backup task is waiting for data, or is waiting for a buffer in which to store data

-- *** CPU Related Waits ***
-- SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD  Occurs when a task voluntarily yields the scheduler for other tasks to execute. 
--                      During this wait the task is waiting for its quantum to be renewed.

-- THREADPOOL			Occurs when a task is waiting for a worker to run on. 
--                      This can indicate that the maximum worker setting is too low, or that batch executions are taking 
--                      unusually long, thus reducing the number of workers available to satisfy other batches.
-- CX_PACKET			Occurs when trying to synchronize the query processor exchange iterator 
--						You may consider lowering the degree of parallelism if contention on this wait type becomes a problem


-- Query 2 - Memory Clerk Usage *******************************************************

-- Memory Clerk Usage for instance
-- Look for high value for CACHESTORE_SQLCP (Ad-hoc query plans)
SELECT TOP(10) [type] AS [Memory Clerk Type], SUM(single_pages_kb) AS [SPA Mem, Kb] 
FROM sys.dm_os_memory_clerks 
GROUP BY [type]  
ORDER BY SUM(single_pages_kb) DESC OPTION (RECOMPILE);

-- CACHESTORE_SQLCP  SQL Plans         These are cached SQL statements or batches that aren't in 
--                                     stored procedures, functions and triggers
-- CACHESTORE_OBJCP  Object Plans      These are compiled plans for stored procedures, 
--                                     functions and triggers
-- CACHESTORE_PHDR   Algebrizer Trees  An algebrizer tree is the parsed SQL text that 
--                                     resolves the table and column names


-- Query 3 - Most Expensive Stored Procedures for CPU Pressure ************************

-- Top Cached SPs By Total Worker time (SQL 2008). Worker time relates to CPU cost
SELECT TOP(25) p.name AS [SP Name], qs.total_worker_time AS [TotalWorkerTime], 
qs.total_worker_time/qs.execution_count AS [AvgWorkerTime], qs.execution_count, 
ISNULL(qs.execution_count/DATEDIFF(Second, qs.cached_time, GETDATE()), 0) AS [Calls/Second],
qs.total_elapsed_time, qs.total_elapsed_time/qs.execution_count 
AS [avg_elapsed_time], qs.cached_time
FROM sys.procedures AS p
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats AS qs
ON p.[object_id] = qs.[object_id]
WHERE qs.database_id = DB_ID()
ORDER BY qs.total_worker_time DESC OPTION (RECOMPILE);

-- This helps you find the most expensive cached stored procedures from a CPU perspective
-- You should look at this if you see signs of CPU pressure


-- Query 4 - Finding Bad Indexes *****************************************************

-- Possible Bad NC Indexes (writes > reads)
SELECT OBJECT_NAME(s.[object_id]) AS [Table Name], i.name AS [Index Name], i.index_id,
user_updates AS [Total Writes], user_seeks + user_scans + user_lookups AS [Total Reads],
user_updates - (user_seeks + user_scans + user_lookups) AS [Difference]
FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats AS s WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN sys.indexes AS i WITH (NOLOCK)
ON s.[object_id] = i.[object_id]
AND i.index_id = s.index_id
WHERE OBJECTPROPERTY(s.[object_id],'IsUserTable') = 1
AND s.database_id = DB_ID()
AND user_updates > (user_seeks + user_scans + user_lookups)
AND i.index_id > 1
ORDER BY [Difference] DESC, [Total Writes] DESC, [Total Reads] ASC OPTION (RECOMPILE);

-- Look for indexes with high numbers of writes and zero or very low numbers of reads
-- Consider your complete workload
-- Investigate further before dropping an index


-- Query 5 - Finding Missing Indexes **************************************************

-- Missing Indexes current database by Index Advantage
SELECT user_seeks * avg_total_user_cost * (avg_user_impact * 0.01) AS [index_advantage], 
migs.last_user_seek, mid.[statement] AS [Database.Schema.Table],
mid.equality_columns, mid.inequality_columns, mid.included_columns,
migs.unique_compiles, migs.user_seeks, migs.avg_total_user_cost, migs.avg_user_impact
FROM sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats AS migs WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_missing_index_groups AS mig WITH (NOLOCK)
ON migs.group_handle = mig.index_group_handle
INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_missing_index_details AS mid WITH (NOLOCK)
ON mig.index_handle = mid.index_handle
WHERE mid.database_id = DB_ID() -- Remove this to see for entire instance
ORDER BY index_advantage DESC OPTION (RECOMPILE);

-- Look at last user seek time, number of user seeks to help determine source and importance
-- SQL Server is overly eager to add included columns, so beware
-- Do not just blindly add indexes that show up from this query!!!
